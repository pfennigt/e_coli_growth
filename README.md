# e_coli_growth
An investigation of the growth of Escherichia coli strains W3110Z1 and W3110 using optical measurement of culture parameters and measurements of drymass and metabolites.


# Structure information

This project is structured in the style of ISA: https://isa-tools.org/index.html
	investigation: "High level concept to link related studies"
		The overall project of investigating the E. coli growth
		This uppermost folder level will also be called the investigation folder
		The data analysis scrips expect this folders path to be set as the INVESTIGATIONPATH variable

	study: "The central unit, containing information on the subject under study, its characteristic and any treatment applied. A study has assays"
		The different experiments performed during the investigation
		If multiple measurements are performed on the same samples or during the same protocol, they belong to the same study
		A study may be logically split into sub-studies, e.g. if different carbon sources or strain were used in parallel in the protocol. In this case the sub-studies are separately read and analyzed
		Can be found in folder 01_studies. The file studies_index.csv gives information to each study and possible sub-studies
		Studies are consecutively named with an identifier (e.g. "SDY001"), a short token for better understanding (e.g. "HighGA"), and a short string explining the experiment further (e.g. "gradient_GA_test")
		
		The folders containall relevant assays, supplementary data/ files, and an explanatory README.md file
		
	assay: "Test performed either on material taken from the subject or on the whole initial subject, which produce qualitative or quantitative measurements (data)"
		The single measurements performed within a study, leading directly to data
		Are consecutively named with an identifier (e.g. "ASY001") and a description of the performed measurement/ the collected data (e.g. "biolector_data")
		
		The folders contain all relevant data, metadata, supplementary data, a read_data.R file (or multiple for sub-studies), and an explanatory README.md file

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
	Information to used media and references can be found in 06_manuscripts/Studying_Multiple_Growth_Phases_of_E_coli_on_Minimal_Medium_with_Experiment_and_Theory_Tobias_Pfennig.pdf

	Experiments were performed on Escherichia coli strain W3110Z1 (genotype: laciq, PN25-tetR, SpR, IN(rrnD-rrnE)1, rph-1, (see: ATCC 39936); received from: Expressys (Dr. Rolf Lutz)) or strain W3110 (genotype: IN(rrnD-rrnE)1, rph-1, (see: ATCC 39936)).
	
	Typically the Bacteria were defrosted and held in preculture using M9 minimal medium with either glucose or acetate as carbon source. Then, the bacteria were pipetted into media with predefined conditions and grown in a BioLector Pro (m2p-labs GmbH, Baesweiler, Germany) bioreactor. There, the bioreactor recorded optically measured culture parameters: backscatter, riboflavin fluorescence, pH , O2 saturation, and NADH fluorescence.
	
	Depending on the experiment time series sampling was performed. Then, the dry mass or metabolite concentrations (acetate, glucose, or glycogen) were measured.
